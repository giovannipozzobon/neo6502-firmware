TODO List
---------

General
-------

	- Working release is dependent on USB Flash progress.
 	  SDCard should be a backup if at all possible as can block UEXT SPI usage.

	- The peculiar LoadROM bug. It will not copy from Flash memory when the display is initialised
	  beyond a certain non-consistent amount. This suggests some sort of timing issue or cache crash ?
	  May need specialist help with this one. It is not important, save the difficulty of a clean
	  restart of BASIC.

	- Current clock 6.25 Mhz, this may be reduced if some boards can't cope.

Larger Additions
----------------

	- Merge CPM65 PR

	- Cat Wildcard (post Merge ?)

	- Serial uploading
		- save to storage option. 

	- Sprites 
		- something like AMAL - write spec document, probably bytecode
		
	- Add USB Joystick interface if stable.

	- Sweet16 code run on the RP2040 and baby assembler for it :)
	
Other
-----
	- Start the code review.
	- Ongoing bug fixes
